This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Type git clone https://github.com/victorgtrrz/personal-porfolio.git in a terminal, inside the directory you want this project to be hosted.

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm i
# or
bun
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Miscellaneous

Alter the languages of the application in the Navbar component, but remember to add them in the arrayTexts prop of <Text /> Component.

For each project in the /Projects section, add two images of the brand, one in black #000000 and other in green #00ff000

I suggest changing the favicon of the project to give it a more personal look. You can do it by changing the favicon.ico inside the root of the /app folder. Do not change the size, though. It must be 128x128.

Aditionally, modify the metadata to give information about your portfolio which could benefit the SEO
